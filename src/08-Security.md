# Security

DevOps, focusing on speed and efficiency, can inadvertently introduce `security risks` if not managed carefully. 

In essence, security is not an afterthought in `DevOps`; it's an integral part of the process. Organizations can achieve faster, more secure software delivery by prioritizing security from the outset.

# Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) brings significant efficiency, consistency, and reproducibility advantages. 

However, it also introduces new security challenges such as the amplification of errors, and increased `attack surface` due to the high amount of pieces interconnected in distributed systems.
