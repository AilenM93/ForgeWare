# Learning Theory

The software engineering landscape is constantly evolving. Understanding learning theories equips developers with the tools and strategies to become self-directed learners. This allows them to stay updated with new technologies and adapt to ongoing changes. Understanding learning theory empowers one to learn faster and fosters continuous growth and adaptation in this dynamic field.

# Simulation Based Training

Simulation-based training, as the name suggests, is a training method that creates realistic imitations of real-world scenarios. It's essentially like practicing in a controlled environment that mimics the pressure and situations you might encounter in the actual field.
