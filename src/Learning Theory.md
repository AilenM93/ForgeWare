# Learning Theory

The software engineering landscape is constantly evolving. Understanding learning theories equips developers with the tools and strategies to become self-directed learners. This allows them to stay updated with new technologies and adapt to ongoing changes. Understanding learning theory empowers one to learn faster and fosters continuous growth and adaptation in this dynamic field.

# Simulation Based Training

Simulation-based training, as the name suggests, is a training method that creates realistic imitations of real-world scenarios. It's like practicing in a controlled environment that mimics the situations you might encounter in the field.[1](https://journals.lww.com/ccmjournal/abstract/2006/01000/simulation_based_training_is_superior_to.21.aspx) 

# Relevance Weights and Order

Pareto's Law, often called the 80/20 rule, suggests that 80% of your results come from 20% of your efforts. While this ratio might vary, the core idea remains: a small input often yields a disproportionately large output. To maximize learning we must apply Parettos's law and weight skills by relevance and order them accordingly.
