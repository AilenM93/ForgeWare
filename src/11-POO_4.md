# Vectors 

Vectors are like expandable arrays. They can grow or shrink in size based on the elements you add or remove.

| Operation	   | Description	                                     | Example (assuming double elements)     |
|--------------|---------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Declaration  | Creates a vector object with an initial capacity. | double[] myVector = new double[10];    |
Space Allocation	Reserves memory for the specified number of elements.	This happens automatically during declaration.
Access to a Vector Position	Retrieves the element at a specific index.	double value = myVector[3];
Size Access	Gets the current number of elements in the vector.	int vectorSize = myVector.length;
