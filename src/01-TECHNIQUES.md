# Black-Box
User-centric perspective: Black box testing mimics how an end-user interacts with the software, ensuring it meets user expectations and requirements.   
Identifies usability issues: By focusing on the user interface, it helps uncover usability problems, making the software more intuitive and user-friendly

# White-box

Uncovers hidden defects: By examining the code, testers can find logical errors, such as incorrect calculations, infinite loops, or incorrect conditional statements.   
Improved code quality: Identifying and fixing these errors early in the development process prevents issues from propagating to later stages.

# Experience-based
Experience-based testing leverages the tester's knowledge, intuition, and past experiences to explore a software system and uncover potential defects.Flexibility: It's highly adaptable to evolving requirements, designs, and schedules.
Quick response: Testers can quickly react to new information and adjust their testing strategy accordingly.
