# Performance & Optimization

By monitoring container performance metrics like CPU, memory, and network usage, you can identify and troubleshoot issues before they impact users. This proactive approach helps prevent outages and ensures a high level of service quality for your applications.

# Requirements

1. Docker: Container management
2. Prometheus: Scrapes metrics
3. Node Exporter: Export metrics
4. cAdvisor: Scrapes specific metrics for containers
5. Grafana: Build dashboards for monitoring

# Folder Structure

A well-defined structure promotes modularity.  Each service or component can reside in its own directory,  encapsulating its configuration files, Dockerfile, and any related scripts.  This promotes reusability and independent development of each service.

```bash
#! bin\bash

echo "Creating Folder Structure"

mkdir -p promgrafnode/prometheus
mkdir -p promgrafnode/grafana/provissioning
touch promgrafnode/docker-compose.yml
touch promgrafnode/prometheus/prometheus.yml

echo "Folder Structure Created"

```

# Docker-Compose file

We will write all the dependencies we need in the docker-compose file and it will be created for us like magic.

```yml


```
