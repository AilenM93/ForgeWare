# Creating a CI/CD pipeline with Azure DevOps

It's a methodology that automates the `software development` process, from building and testing to deployment. By automating repetitive tasks, `CI/CD` significantly reduces the time it takes to get new features or bug fixes into production.

```ruby

trigger:
  - main  # The pipeline will be triggered whenever there's a push to the main branch.

pool:
  vmImage: ubuntu-latest # Defines where the pipeline tasks will be executed.

steps:
- task: TerraformInstaller@1 # Installs a specific version of Terraform
  inputs:
    terraformVersion: 'v1.7.4'

- task: TerraformTaskV4@4 # Executes Terraform commands.
  inputs: # Defines the input parameters for the task
    provider: 'azurerm' # Tells Terraform to use the Azure Resource Manager provider.
    command: 'init' # Specifies the Terraform command to be executed. 
    backendServiceArm: 'bknd-prod-001(f97a229a-2aa9-47e7-ae31-76ed06c11e1d)'
    backendAzureRmResourceGroupName: 'rg-terraformdevops-001'
    backendAzureRmStorageAccountName: 'stterraformdevops01'
    backendAzureRmContainerName: 'terraform'
    backendAzureRmKey: 'y9d6HEg1PDSZBTjxfFG+vN4bctj1qPIHKVnB3a82SMhSJa1bJjvfsloJDw0J5pYzKfVbVVQwBYpC+AStA5P4pw=='
- task: TerraformTaskV4@4
  inputs:
    provider: 'azurerm'
    command: 'validate'
- task: TerraformTaskV4@4
  inputs:
    provider: 'azurerm'
    command: 'apply'
    environmentServiceNameAzureRM: 'bknd-prod-001(1)(f97a229a-2aa9-47e7-ae31-76ed06c11e1d)'

```

# Conclusion

By leveraging Azure Pipelines' features, you can achieve continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) for your projects, ensuring consistent and reliable deployments. We encourage you to explore the code, customize it for your specific needs, and contribute improvements.  The provided examples showcase common CI/CD workflows, but the possibilities are vast.
