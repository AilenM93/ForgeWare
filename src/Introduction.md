# Introduction

The Software Engineering market is like any other market. Everyone wants to be the first. Meaning? We must match our users' needs before our competitors do. For that to happen we need to `ship` quality `code faster`. And for that, we need to automate. 

Simply put; anything that could be automated, must. Normally that goes for three main operations. `Testing, Building, and Deployment`. The diagram below illustrates a core Software Development pipeline along with its according phase of the SDLC (Software development Life Cycle).

# Table of Contents

In the upcoming chapters, we will demonstrate the use of some core DevOps practices and tools.

1.`Automating creation of users, directories, permissions and groups with Bash:`
This script will automate the creation of new developer accounts on the system, assign them directories and permissions based on their role, and add them to relevant development groups. This eliminates manual setup and ensures consistency.
`BEGINNER` `BASH` `LINUX`

2.`Implementing a version control system with Git/Github:`
We will use Git for version control and GitHub for a central repository. Developers will have access to the latest codebase and can track changes efficiently.
`BEGINNER` `GIT` `GITHUB`

3.`Deploying infrastructure with Terraform:`
Terraform will automate infrastructure provisionings, such as servers, databases, and storage on a chosen cloud platform. This ensures consistent and repeatable infrastructure deployment.
`INTERMEDIATE` `TERRAFORM` `CLOUD COMPUTING`

4.`Creation of CI/CD pipeline with Azure DevOps:`
Azure DevOps will be used to create a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline. Upon code commit, the pipeline will automatically build, test, and deploy the application to a staging environment.
`INTERMEDIATE` `AZURE DEVOPS` `DEVOPS`

5.`Containerizing an application with Docker:`
The application will be containerized using Docker, creating a self-contained package with all dependencies. This promotes portability and simplifies deployments.
`INTERMEDIATE` `DOCKER` `LINUX`

6.`Deploying a web application with Kubernetes:`
Kubernetes will be used to orchestrate the deployment of Docker containers across multiple servers for scalability and high availability.
`ADVANCED` `KUBERNETES` `DOCKER`

7.`Automating Web App deployment with Bash`
A Bash script will trigger the Azure DevOps pipeline upon code commit, automating the entire deployment process.
`ADVANCED` `BASH` `LINUX` `AZURE DEVOPS`

8.`Setting developing environment with Vagrant:`
To provide developers with a consistent local development environment, Vagrant will be used to create virtual machines pre-configured with all the necessary tools and dependencies.
`ADVANCED` `VAGRANT` `IAC`

# Conclussion

This combination of scripts automates the entire development and deployment process, saving time, increasing efficiency, and reducing errors. This allows software engineering teams to focus on developing innovative features faster and more efficiently.

# Next

We will use IAC concepts to automate the creation of users, directories, and groups with a Bash script.
