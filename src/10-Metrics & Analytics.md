# Metrics and Analytics
Metrics and analytics are the lifeblood of DevOps. They provide the data-driven insights needed to optimize software delivery pipelines, improve efficiency, and enhance overall product quality.

# Metrics
These metrics provide a foundation. The specific metrics you track will depend on your organization's goals and industry.

| Metric                              | Formula                                          | Description                                                |
|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Deployment Frequency                | # of deployments / time period                   | How often code is deployed to production                   |
| Lead Time for Changes               | Time from code commit to production              | Time taken for code to move from development to production |
| Mean Time to Recover (MTTR)         | Downtime / # of failures                         | Average time to restore a service after failure            |
| Change Failure Rate                 | # of failed deployments / # of total deployments | Percentage of deployments resulting in failures            |
| Cycle Time                          | Time from code commit to feature release         | Total time spent on a piece of work                        |
| Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF)   | Time between failures / # of failures            | Average time between system failures                       |
| Defect Escape Rate                  | # of defects found / # of total defects          | Percentage of defects that reach production                |
| Build Success Rate                  | # of successful builds / # of total builds       | Percentage of successful build processes                   |
| Test Case Execution Time            | Total test execution time / # of test cases      | Average time taken to run a test case                      |
