# Functional

| TECHNIQUE | DESCRIPTION | 
|-----------|-------------|
| Unit Testing | Tests individual units of code (functions, modules) | 
| Integration Testing | Tests how different units interact with each other.| 
| System Testing | Tests the entire system as a whole. |
| Acceptance Testing | Verifies if the system meets user requirements. | 

# Non-Functional

| TECHNIQUE | DESCRIPTION |
|-----------|-------------|
| Performance Testing | Evaluates system performance under load. | 
| Usability Testing | Evaluates user experience with the software. |
| Mutation Testing | Introduces deliberate errors (mutations) in the code and checks if tests detect them. |
| Capture-Replay Testing | Records user interactions and replays them for regression testing. |
