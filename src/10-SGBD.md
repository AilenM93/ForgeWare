# Prerequisites

1. MySQL Community Server
2. MySQL Workbench

# Connecting Via CLI

The CLI(command line interface) provides a direct way to interact with the `database server`. 

```ruby
mysql -u root -p
```

# Modeling With MySql Workbench

MySQL Workbench offers a set of tools for modeling and `designing databases`.

# SQL Categories

In SQL, there are five main categories of commands, each serving a specific purpose in managing and interacting with databases. By understanding these different categories of SQL commands, you can effectively manage your database, ensuring proper `data structure`, manipulation, `security`, and retrieval capabilities.

# DML

DML stands for `Data Manipulation Language`. It's a category of languages used in computer programs or by database users to interact with data in a database. Its main commands are `SELECT`; `INSERT`; `UPDATE`; and `DELETE`.

| `SELECT` column1 `FROM` table;                                 | `SELECT` column1 `FROM` table           |                                                     |                      
| `INSERT INTO` table_name `VALUES` value1;                      | 
| `UPDATE` table_name `SET` column1 = value1, `WHERE` condition; |              
| `DELETE FROM` table_name `WHERE` condition;                    |                    



# Conclusion

This repository has equipped you with a comprehensive understanding of MySQL, from its core concepts to `advanced functionalities`. You've explored data manipulation, querying, security, administration, and even how to leverage views for optimized data access.
