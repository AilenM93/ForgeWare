# Problem
Running individual containers on multiple machines can be cumbersome. Docker Swarm eliminates the need to manually deploy containers on each node. A single machine failure can bring down your entire application if your containers are running solely on that machine. Docker Swarm ensures high availability by automatically rescheduling containers to healthy nodes if a node fails. Docker Swarm simplifies container orchestration at scale, ensuring high availability, efficient resource utilization, and streamlined management of your containerized applications.
