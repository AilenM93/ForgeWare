## Docker Compose
Acme Corp. struggling with its complex application. Developers battled with inconsistent environments, leading to bugs. Deployments were slow and cumbersome, requiring manual intervention for each service.

```ruby
version: '3.9'
services:
  apache:
    image: httpd:latest
    container_name: my-apache-app
    ports:
    - '8081:80'
    volumes:
    - ./website:/usr/local/apache2/htdocs
```
