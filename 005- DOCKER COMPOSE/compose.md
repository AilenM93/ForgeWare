## Docker Compose
Acme Corp was struggling with its complex application. Developers battled with inconsistent environments, leading to bugs. Deployments were slow and cumbersome, requiring manual intervention for each service. Docker Compose came to the rescue! With a single YAML file, Docker Compose ensured a uniform development environment for everyone, eliminating bugs caused by environment mismatches. Deploying the entire application became a one-click operation, streamlining the process significantly.

```ruby
version: '3.9'
services:
  apache:
    image: httpd:latest
    container_name: my-apache-app
    ports:
    - '8081:80'
    volumes:
    - ./website:/usr/local/apache2/htdocs
```
## Conclusion
Docker Compose managed adding or removing service instances with ease. Finally, version control of the YAML configuration file simplified version management for all their services.
In short, Docker Compose helped Acme Corp. achieve faster development cycles, smoother deployments, and better scalability for their application.
