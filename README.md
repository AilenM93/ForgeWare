## DevOps: Handbook <br>
*Mastering Version Control, Containerization, and Automated Deployments with Code-Driven Infrastructure*

**Pre-built CI/CD** Code Examples: Battle-tested code snippets for common DevOps tasks, designed to **integrate seamlessly** into your pipeline. Copy, paste, and customize for your specific infrastructure. Designed as a foundation to tackle even the most advanced DevOps challenges, regardless of industry or codebase size.

## Example Usage
Using IaC principles to **automate directory structures** within your infrastructure.

```ruby
#!/bin/bash

# Creating directories
sudo mkdir /public  # sudo execute the command with superuser privileges
sudo mkdir /adm     # mkdir is the command for creating a directory
sudo mkdir /sales
sudo mkdir /operations

# Creating groups
sudo groupadd GRP_ADM  # groupadd creates a new group
sudo groupadd GRP_SALES
sudo groupadd GRP_OPS

```
