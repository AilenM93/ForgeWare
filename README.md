## Example Usage
Using IaC principles to automate directory structures within your infrastructure.

```ruby
#!/bin/bash

# Creating directories
sudo mkdir /public  # sudo execute the command with superuser privileges
sudo mkdir /adm     # mkdir is the command for creating a directory
sudo mkdir /sales
sudo mkdir /operations

# Creating groups
sudo groupadd GRP_ADM  # groupadd creates a new group
sudo groupadd GRP_SALES
sudo groupadd GRP_OPS

```
