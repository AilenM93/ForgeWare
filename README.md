# 01-DevOps
*What you will find*

This repository is a comprehensive showcase of my proficiency in DevOps best practices and tools. A collection of projects demonstrating the automation of infrastructure provisioning, application deployments, and workflow streamlining using industry-standard DevOps tools.

> [!NOTE]
> You will find practical examples of how I leverage DevOps to achieve:<br>
> **Efficiency**: Reduced manual tasks and streamlined workflows for faster development and deployment cycles.<br>
> **Reliability**: Consistent and error-free infrastructure and application configurations through code-driven automation.<br>
> **Collaboration**: Improved visibility and communication across development and operations teams.<br>

### [001-User, directories & permission structure creation](https://github.com/AleMorales9011/01-DEVOPS-AWS/blob/da5613ce95572d95cf385536b78fb5c5a93dfb51/001-USER%2CDIRECTORIES%20%26%20PERMISSION%20STRUCTURE%20CREATION)
> [!CAUTION]
> Creating new users on a system often involves repetitive tasks like:
> Manually adding users through system commands.
> Creating dedicated home directories for each user.
> Setting appropriate permissions on the home directory and potentially subdirectories.
> Repeating these steps for every new user, can be time-consuming and prone to errors.

> [!TIP]
> Solution: Automated User and Directory Management Script.<br>
> This script automates the entire user and directory creation process, offering several key benefits:<br>
> **Streamlined Workflow:** Automates user creation, home directory creation, and permission setting with a single script execution.<br>
> **Enhanced Security:** Enforces consistent and secure permission settings for all users by design.<br>
> **Reduced Errors:** Eliminates the risk of human error associated with manual data entry.<br>

| Metric  | Before | After |

### [002-Git-creating & pushing repositories](https://github.com/AleMorales9011/01-DEVOPS-AWS/blob/5abedca77facd49710abf7a2f6a5a520ce22f852/002-GIT-CREATING%20%26%20PUSHING%20REPOSITORIES)
*Starting with git and github*

This script aims to describe the **easiest way to get started with GIT**. Git is a version control system that tracks changes made to files over time. This means you can see exactly what modifications were made, by whom, and when.
>- It allows you to **revert to previous versions** of your project if necessary. This is a lifesaver if you accidentally introduce bugs or make unwanted changes.
>- Git is essential for collaboration, enabling multiple people to work on the same project simultaneously without conflicts. It **facilitates merging changes** from different developers and keeps track of everyone's contributions.

### [003-Architecture-Bff-pattern]()

This project demonstrates how to use Azure DevOps and Terraform to **implement the Backends for Frontends (BFF) pattern** in Microsoft Azure. The BFF pattern is a software architecture pattern that allows you to create separate backend services for different front-end applications or interfaces. This approach helps improve your applications' maintainability, scalability, and performance.
