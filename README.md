Git is a version control system that tracks changes made to files over time. This means you can see exactly what modifications were made, by whom, and when.
- It allows you to revert to previous versions of your project if necessary. This is a lifesaver if you accidentally introduce bugs or make unwanted changes.
- Git is essential for collaboration, enabling multiple people to work on the same project simultaneously without conflicts. It facilitates merging changes from different developers and keeps track of everyone's contributions.
