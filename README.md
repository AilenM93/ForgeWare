### [002-Git-creating & pushing repositories](https://github.com/AleMorales9011/01-DEVOPS-AWS/blob/5abedca77facd49710abf7a2f6a5a520ce22f852/002-GIT-CREATING%20%26%20PUSHING%20REPOSITORIES)

This script aims to describe the **easiest way to get started with GIT**. Git is a version control system that tracks changes made to files over time. This means you can see exactly what modifications were made, by whom, and when.
- It allows you to **revert to previous versions** of your project if necessary. This is a lifesaver if you accidentally introduce bugs or make unwanted changes.
- Git is essential for collaboration, enabling multiple people to work on the same project simultaneously without conflicts. It **facilitates merging changes** from different developers and keeps track of everyone's contributions.

### [003-Architecture-Bff-pattern]()

This project demonstrates how to use Azure DevOps and Terraform to **implement the Backends for Frontends (BFF) pattern** in Microsoft Azure. The BFF pattern is a software architecture pattern that allows you to create separate backend services for different front-end applications or interfaces. This approach helps improve your applications' maintainability, scalability, and performance.
